                                                <p> <span class="GeneralPrinterInstaller" data-mc-conditions="General.NoHosted">Printer Installer</span> is the product your print administrator is using to manage printers in your work environment. Your administrator is using this product because it eliminates the need for a print server and enables your administrator to manage all the printers and workstations from one place. </p>
                                                <p><span class="GeneralPrinterInstaller" data-mc-conditions="General.NoHosted">Printer Installer</span> makes printing easier on you as well. In short, the days of searching for drivers to install on your workstation are over. For example, have you ever been in a new office and needed to print something? What steps do you take? Usually, those steps include asking someone where the drivers are located on the network, navigating to that location (assuming you have access to those drivers), and using the Windows Add Printer feature to set up the printer drivers. What if your company had a website that enables you to install drivers quickly and easily? Because your administrator is using <span class="GeneralPrinterInstaller" data-mc-conditions="General.NoHosted">Printer Installer</span>, you now have such a website.</p>
                                                <p>If driver installation from a website doesn't pique your interest, then perhaps the ability to send a print job that is "held" until you decide to release it might be compelling. This feature might be attractive for people who regularly print personal information on other employees. For example, let's say you have a form with payroll and tax information on it. Normally, printing such a document requires you to run over to the printer to grab the paper before anyone else can see what's printed. With <span class="GeneralPrinterInstaller" data-mc-conditions="General.NoHosted">Printer Installer</span>, the print job is "held" until you decide to release it. What's more, you have several options from which to release that print job, including a website called the Release Portal, any mobile device (phone or tablet), a Control Panel Application installed on your printer, or a simple badge swipe that releases the last print job you sent or even all print jobs you have being held.</p>
                                                <p>Printing difficulties have been a part of office life for decades, and most people have learned to deal with these difficulties as a necessary evil.  <span class="GeneralPrinterInstaller" data-mc-conditions="General.NoHosted">Printer Installer</span> now eliminates not only the print server for your administrator, but it also eliminates printing difficulties for the end-user as well.</p>
                                                <p><span class="GeneralPrinterInstaller" data-mc-conditions="General.NoHosted">Printer Installer</span> comes in three main parts or components that impact you, the end-user. These components are the <span class="GeneralPrinterInstaller" data-mc-conditions="General.NoHosted">Printer Installer</span> client, the Self-service Portal, and the Release Portal. So, how do these components help you?&#160;Let's look at each one individually.</p>
                                            </div>
                                            <!-- Client Tab -->

                                                <p>The client is a piece of software installed on your computer. To put it simply, the client enables your computer to communicate with <span class="GeneralPrinterInstaller" data-mc-conditions="General.NoHosted">Printer Installer</span>. Why is this communication important? Well, the client installed on your computer checks in with  <span class="GeneralPrinterInstaller" data-mc-conditions="General.NoHosted">Printer Installer</span> on a regular basis. If the your administrator has made changes to settings or updates to drivers that are already installed on your computer, then the client will be able to apply those changes or updates to your computer automatically. </p>
                                                <p>For example, let's say you installed the driver for the new HP printer. Three months later, your administrator updates the driver for that HP printer (this is done through the Admin Console, which is the tool your administrator uses to manage <span class="GeneralPrinterInstaller" data-mc-conditions="General.NoHosted">Printer Installer</span>). If you did not have the client installed on your computer, then the updated driver might not ever make it to your computer. But because you have the client installed, and the client checks in with <span class="GeneralPrinterInstaller" data-mc-conditions="General.NoHosted">Printer Installer</span> regularly, the update will get applied to your computer.</p>

Frequently, the administrator will just access your workstation remotely, but If your administrator asks you to shut down the client, to identify information from the client log, or to stop and restart the client, then you can easily perform these tasks from the Client Console. Additionally, by default you can click CTRL &gt; SHIFT &gt; 8 on your keyboard to access the Client Console, however, you can change this shortcut key to open other applications as needed.</p>

                                                        <p>Because Printer Installer enables you to easily add printers to your workstation through the Self-service Portal, then it just makes sense for you to be able to remove printers from your workstation just as easily. In the Start Menu under Printer Installer, select Delete Printer. When the Select a printer to delete window appears, select the printer you want to remove and then click Delete Printer. Similarly, you can right-click the Add Printer icon in the System Tray and then click Delete Printer. Just as with the Start Menu, select the printer you want to remove, and then click Delete Printer.</p>
                                                        <p>If your administrator has a printer set up to be automatically deployed to your workstation, then even if you delete the printer from your workstation, the next time the client checks in with the Printer Installer server, that printer will be re-installed on your workstation. For example, let's say Mary is the print administrator for her company, and she has set up a printer deployment to automatically install Printer A on everyone's workstation. This deployment not only installs the printer on employees' workstations, but any time she updates the printer drivers, then when the client on each workstation checks in with the Printer Installer server, then the drivers are automatically updated. In this instance, suppose John deletes Printer A from his workstation. The next time his workstation checks in with the Printer Installer server, then the printer will again be installed on his workstation because an existing deployment for that printer is still set up. John would need to request (from the administrator) his removal from the actual deployment for the printer to be permanently removed from his workstation. Additionally, keep in mind that any printers you have installed from the Self-service Portal will remain deleted if you have deleted them.</p>

You click Refresh Configurations, and the client installed on your workstation checks-in with the Printer Installer server, and notices the new deployment ready. As a result, the new printer will be installed on your workstation immediately, and you can begin using it right away.</p>

Printer Installer enables you to send print jobs to a specific printer, which will "hold" the print job until you release it either with a badge swipe or a login (with a username and password). For example, let's say Tiffiny works in Human Resources, so right outside her office, she has a printer that she uses regularly because she does not want other people to see confidential information. When she sends a print job to that printer, the printer will hold the job until she releases it.</p>

Furthermore, you open the Secure Print Settings (<span class="EmphasisGray">Start</span> &gt; <span class="EmphasisGray">Printer Installer</span> &gt; <span class="EmphasisGray">Secure Print Settings</span>) for KM 553 to Prompt. With these settings configured, you can click Print for any application on your workstation, and not only will all print jobs automatically go to KM 553, but your workstation will ask you before releasing if you want to send the print job to the printer.</p>

                                                <p>Not so long ago, adding printers to your workstation was nothing short of inconvenient. Believe it or not, some people still work in organizations that continue that same struggle. For example, let's suppose your company moves your team from the first floor to the second floor of your building. Because your IT&#160;department set up your computer to use the printer on the first floor, then you are not yet set up to use the printer on the second floor. So what do you do? </p>
                                                <p>Well, if your IT department is proactive, then they will send you an email with a link and a procedure to install the drivers for the printer on the second floor. However, because most IT departments are frequently overwhelmed, this email does not necessarily arrive, and in the end, the responsibility to find and install the driver lies with the end-user. There is an easier approach. The (missing or bad snippet) Self-service Portal resolves every one of these issues for both the print administrator and the end-user. The image provided below shows a sample of the Self-service Portal. This tool enables you to install printer drivers from a map of the floor plan for your office.</p>

                                                <p>The hierarchy on the left side of the Self-service Portal window is called the tree view. The purpose of the tree view is to enable you to navigate to your location to find your printer so you can install it. Using the image to the left, let's set up an example that helps clarify this point. Suppose your company has offices in four countries, namely the United States, Germany, China, and Mexico. The tree view in the image shows a folder for each of these locations. Furthermore, in the United States, your organization has offices in New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and St. Louis as shown in the sample image. The idea here is to enable you to navigate to your specific location to be able to select a printer for installation. </p>
                                                <p>Keep in mind that your print administrator sets up and manages the tree view. You may have an office that doesn't appear in the list. If that is the case, then your administrator has "hidden" it from view for a very specific purpose. After you have successfully navigated to your location, you may or may not see a map of the actual floor layout. See Map below for details.</p>

                                                <p>Many of us, at one time or another, have struggled to find our bearings in a new work environment. Situations arise where we are placed in a new location, and it is our responsibility to search for co-workers, printers, the break room, and so on. While the Self-service Portal can't help you find your co-workers, it can help you locate a specific printer and install its drivers. Your print administrator will provide you with maps in the Self-service Portal appear for specific folders. Consider the image to the left. Let's suppose you work on the 33rd floor of the Empire State Building. In the tree view of the Self-service Portal, you can navigate all the way to the Floor 33 folder, and because your administrator uploaded a map for that floor, you can see the full layout for the floor. What's more, the icons on the map relate to specific printers. The image shows one printer, so if you were located on Floor 33 of the Empire State Building, you could easily find that printer.</p>
                                                <p>However, showing you the location of the printer is not the only thing that the Self-service Portal does. Click the printer icon, and you can install the drivers for that printer. The Self-service Portal takes you through a very simple wizard to complete any installation. Additionally, the names of the available printers appear in a list below the map. These listed items work the same as any of the icons on the map. In other words, you can click the name of the printer in the list of printers and follow the steps to complete the printer installation. </p>
                                                <p>If a map does not appear for a folder in the tree view, then either the folder is a level at which no printers are to be added, or the administrator has not uploaded a map. For example, the Empire State Building folder would not have printers on it because the building is used by more than one organization. However, Floor 33 and Floor 34 in the example here are both used by the same organization, so they would contain maps (if printers are on those floors). Another reason a map might not appear is that your administrator hasn't uploaded one for a folder in the tree view. In this case, the printers will still appear in the list for you to download. You just won't have a map and an icon from which to download the printer. For example, let's say your print administrator has not uploaded a map for Floor 33. While you will not see a map or the print icon, you will still see the four printers, and you can install those printers. The only difference is you might have to hunt down the printer's actual location.</p>

                                                <p>The Release Portal is a tool specifically designed to do exactly what the name implies - release print jobs - with one caveat. Print jobs that the system "holds" until you release them (also called pull print jobs or secure release print jobs) appear in the Release Portal. Mobile print jobs will also appear in the Release Portal. Any print jobs that are released immediately after you click Print do not appear in the Release Portal. To access the Release Portal, use the same URL you entered to access the Self-service Portal and then add <span class="Emphasis">/Release</span>. For example, if the URL used to access the Self-service Portal is printers.acme.com, then the URL to access the Release Portal is printers.acme.com/release. Your administrator will know the URL to access the Release Portal.</p>
                                                <p>To add a little context, let's say you have installed Printer A on your workstation through the Self-service Portal. Your administrator has designated Printer A to release both pull print jobs and secure release print jobs. Moreover, Printer A is the default printer for your workstation, and you are working in a Word document that you want to print. In Word, you click <span class="Emphasis">File</span> &gt;&#160;<span class="Emphasis">Print</span> to send a print job to the printer. Depending on how your administrator has configured the printer through the Admin Console, one of two things will happen.</p>

Option 2 - when you click <span class="Emphasis">Print</span>, you will be prompted (as shown in the image to the right) to release the print job or to hold the print job. If you click <span class="Emphasis">Yes, Release Job</span>, then the print job will be immediately released to Printer A. If you click <span class="Emphasis">Hold</span>, then the print job will appear as a line item in the Release Portal. Again, keep in mind that the prompt will appear only if your administrator has configured it to appear in your workstation.</p>

                                                <p>The Control Panel Application is a tool that enables you to release pull printing jobs and secure release printing jobs directly from the printer's digital console. Like other <span class="GeneralPrinterInstaller" data-mc-conditions="General.NoHosted">Printer Installer</span> features, your administrator installs the <span class="GeneralCPA">Control Panel Application</span> on the printer from the Admin Console. When you first walk up to the printer's console, you may or may not see the following interface.</p>

                                                <p>Accessing the login screen for the <span class="GeneralCPA">Control Panel Application</span> may vary by printer, but you should be able to easily find it regardless of printer manufacturer and model. By default, <span class="Emphasis">Login Option #1</span> will always appear. You can use your network credentials to log in to the application (these are the same credentials you use to log in to your computer). <span class="Emphasis">Login Option #2</span> will appear if your administrator has installed the application with this option enabled. If not, you will see only <span class="Emphasis">Login Option #1</span>. </p>
                                                <p><span class="Emphasis">Login Option #2</span> is for use with a badge scanner. In some companies, you are provided with a badge, card, or dongle for security purposes, for example, entry to the building. Many IT administrators will tie the badge, card, or dongle to printing as well. So, if your printer contains <span class="Emphasis">Login Option #2</span>, then look around on the printer for a badge scanner as well. The first time you run your badge over the badge scanner, you will be prompted to enter your network credentials (just as you would in <span class="Emphasis">Login Option #1</span>). The benefit to this setup is that once your badge is validated against your credentials, the next time you want to release a print job, all you have to do is swipe your badge to open the <span class="GeneralCPA">Control Panel Application</span>. When you are validated and the <span class="GeneralCPA">Control Panel Application</span> opens, you will see the following window in the printer's console.</p>
                                                <div class="thumbnailImg indent"><a class="MCPopupThumbnailLink MCPopupThumbnailPopup" href="../Images/CPA/CPA_Release_Portal.png"><img class="MCPopupThumbnail img" data-mc-width="801" data-mc-height="479" src="../Images/CPA/CPA_Release_Portal_thumb_250_0.png" style="mc-thumbnail: popup;" tabindex="" /></a>

                                                <p>The <span class="GeneralCPA">Control Panel Application</span> will display only the print jobs being held for the person who logged in. The interface clearly shows that you can select one or more print jobs for release, or you can release all the print jobs for the end-user's account. If you do not see your print jobs, you can press <span class="Emphasis">&lt;Refresh&gt;</span>.</p>
                                                <p>If your printer has a scanner but no interface, you can still release print jobs on the printer. This release process is called Simple Badge Release. You do not need to log in. Instead, your administrator will have set up your badge for release. Additionally, this setup will release either the last print job sent to the queue or it will release all print jobs in queue, but this all depends on how your administrator has set up the Simple Badge Release. Finally, Simple Badge Release generally uses a badge scanner that is attached to the printer via USB rather than a built-in badge scanner.</p>
